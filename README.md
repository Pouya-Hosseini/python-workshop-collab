# python-workshop-collab

A small project to discuss collaboration of coding in python using git

## Description

This project will ultimately consist of a script `plot_sines.py`.  The script 
will plot a variable number of sine waves together in one series with increasingly doubled frequencies.  

## Arguments

The script will take the following arguments:

- A required integer, 'N', determining the number of sine waves to plot
- An optional filename, 'file', to save the plot
- An optional title, 'title', which will display on the figure

## Remember:

1. Choose your task
2. Create a new branch for your task
3. Code your fix, committing often
4. Push your changes to the repository
5. The branches will be merged into the master by the repo owner
